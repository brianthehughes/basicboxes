1. Title Slide - **Basic Boxes**

_Photo slideshow - stack of desktop equipment, implementations_

transititions
- stack close up
- kitchen aio
- office multi workststion
- garage r&d
- laptop


2. Introduction Slide - **What, Why, and How**

What are we doing? What purpose are we pursuing or fullfilling?

Basic Boxes aims to explore the bottom of GhostBSD System Requirements and provide the community with a perspective on affordable desktop computing for the average user. 

Why does this matter? 

Technology is now an ever-present side-kick to humanity.

Can 5++, 10+, 15, 20-, 30-- year old technology support personal, family, and/or business connectivity goals in the encrypted and media rich data stream?




3. Approach / Premise - **5-20 year old technology CAN support connectivity in 2025**

Approach

the browser era

limiting factors

- When did display texhnology start to handle 720p smoothly?
- The decoding video / streaming inflection.

_**What are some valued use cases user/application profiles?**_


- Desktop - Office/Media/Tech
- Dewktop Dev - Full/Dev
- Desktop TV - Web
- Desktop Student - Office
- Desktop Family - Web/Office/Media

- Business - Office
- Business Media - Office/Media
- Business Dev - Full/Dev
- Business Service - Core/_Service_




6. Connectivity Profles - Person, Family, Business Actors




7. Resourcing - **$50 or less**


**Resourcing - How and Where and Why**

but not in that order 

Where

_**Social Markets - Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, Craigslist, eBay**_

Why

_Seller Profiles_

- A - Downsizing - Formerly successful in technical field
- B - Post School Technical - Recently successful
- C.1 - Liquidation / Estate / Uninformed Seller - business close out / estate sale / landlords / third party
- C.2 - Broken Batches and Bundle Bargains
- D - Lost and Found - Questionable Ownership - Stolen - dont have pw!

How

_**Free Technology**_

- time = money

- $50 = 2 hours

Average cost of a dinner out? $50+	



8. More for less - **Go the distance, because you're already going**




_**Peripherals & e-waste**_

Anything to/with/for HDMI - because TVs

- dp-hdmi $10-15
- vga-hdmi, dvi-hdmi $10
- vga + usb audio to hdmi! $20 

always accept, reasonable amounts of:
- could you use ...
- can yout take ....
- will ypu get rid of ..



9. What are we running for $50 or less - **Who's ready for a spreadsheet?**

10. Community Imput - **Laptop, Desktop, 'Service-op'**


_**Ghost Recommendations**_
(Working title, area, what are the easiest solid machines, worth it machines?)

Would like to collect a best Laptop, best Micro sets from GhostBSD Community members:

Mini / Small Desktop
- Intel NUC
- Dell 3040, 9020

Tower Desktop
- Mac Pro
- Dell Precision

Laptop / AIO
- hp 520-1032
- iMac





limitations

gaming - no
multi tasking - stream content AND what? - be serious


Go further - Homelab?

Planning for shared resources
- Laptop/Micro PC common RAM 
- Laptop SSDs

Network management
Media Services
Storage Services
JBOC cluster compute? 

_**Appendix C.1**_

**Special Consideration **

Virtual / Remote

- virtual box - host multiple on powerful
- qemu - tbd

- rdp - Tested current 
- vnc - tbd
- obs/vlc? - Free the DESKTOP video stream

Appendix C.2

Projects

- vs World - 2025 init tbd - just a calendar app
- Basic Boxes - 202412 -> current
- GhostBSDCon 2025 -  202409 -> current
- sRPM - 2024 - student capstone sponsor


_**Appendix B.1**_

**Benchmarking**

- Phoronix Test Suite - Benchmark Phoronix Self Test


_**Apprendix A.1**_

**Notes along the way - What we learned**

- Live
- 
Quick stop at Live Environments, Live Installers, and the challenge of experiencing a Live OS on Minimum Requirements.

1. Please approach a Live Environment with 200% Minimum Requirement RAM
2. See #1

(Graphic to explain system resources in a RAMDRIVE driven Live Environment)
